This repository contains a watchface which is designed to work together with watch Companion APP and Android phone Watchdrip application (see the latest version on Patreon page). 

The watchface can display a dynamic data from the Android phone Watchdrip application by using the ZeppOS fetch API.

This version features 7 editable data widgets. You can change the data displayed in edit mode on the watch. Long-tap the watchface and tap the blue pencil below the watchface.
